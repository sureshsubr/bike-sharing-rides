# bike-sharing-rides
Predict bike sharing rides using Neural Network.  This project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Introduction

In this project we'll predict bike sharing rides from historical time series bike rental data using Neural Network.  We'll implement gradient descent, backpropagation, training and testing. 

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

# Instructions

    Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. 
    cd into the project-bikesharing directory.
    Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson. These are also outlined in the repository README.
    Create a new conda environment:

    conda create --name deep-learning python=3

    Enter your new environment:
        Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning
        Windows: >> activate deep-learning
